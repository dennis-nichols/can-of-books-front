  Dennis - understanding server setup more intuitively, getting better at UI design
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?


### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  We’ll talk directly about it and find out what the underlying reason is.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  We’ll talk directly about it and find out what the underlying reason is - e.g. if that person is anxious about not getting done in time or something.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in     understanding and skill level?
  We’ll try to split up the work based on our strengths and each person will give an honest effort.
